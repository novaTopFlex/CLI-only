# CLI-only
This is an all-CLI program to maximize the potential of the command-line interface, complete in two separate versions.
# Usage
If you already know the respective terminal commands (so long as they are already installed on your system), then please use the `CLIonly.sh` script.  
If you do not know the appropriate commands, please use the `CLIonly-Human.sh` wrapper instead. The commands will be in the same order as on the regular script but with more useful and human-friendly context for the descriptions.
